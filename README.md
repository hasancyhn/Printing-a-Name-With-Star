* PRINTING NAME WITH CHARACTERS
Please write a Python code that dynamically determines the size, based on user input, and prints your name from top to bottom using characters.
1- All letter characters should be arranged in a square area according to the entered size value. For example, if the size value is 7, all characters should be displayed in a 7x7 square area.
2- Dots and lines in the letters can be ignored. For example, dots in the letter "Ü" or lines in the letter "Ş" can be omitted.
3- It is sufficient to select and print one of the multiple names, if there are any.
4- All letters should be printed using loops and conditional statements, without using functions or lists. No built-in functions should be used except for input and output functions.
5- No external Python libraries should be included in the assignment.
